  <h1>Save Your Eyes</h1>
<p><img src="eyes.jpeg"alt="Save Your eyes " </p>

    <p>This picture is a safety adverstiment telling workers to protect their eyes while they work.
      <br>Perhaps there was a time where a lot of workers at thsi time that were not wearing the goggles and they had to enfroce the issue to the public a little more.</br>
       The picture also looks like old propaganda in the early times.<br> It's saying stay protective but don't be afriad and come work.</p>
