      <p>This picture is an old picture advertisment of the Brookfield zoo. <br>Personally I think the picture could be a little intimidating for kids wanting to go to the zoo.
        A huge black panther will probably send the wrong message to some kids at the zoo.<br> But the artwork of the advertisment is also intriuging in a way that makes you really want to see what the panther <br>looks like in real life.</p>
