    <p> This poster looks like a company that advertises to make posters for other people. <br> The thing i'm kind of confused about is what makes it a "Federal Art project".<br>
      From the looks of it it looks like a pretty basic poster but I do feel like there's a deeper meaning in the poster that has to do something of what was going on in that enviorment at the time.</p>
